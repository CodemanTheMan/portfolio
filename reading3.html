			<h1>Reading</h1>
			<h2>1 - TO BUILD A FIRE</h2>
      <p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158361
      </p>
      <p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I remember building a fire. As in, the mention of fire brings back memories of a holiday at a Vysočina cottage with my brother. We had a tennis field, a pond and books, but all we would do all day is maintain a fire. We’d light it in the morning, and just kept bringing wood from the stockpile and nearby forest, cutting it with an axe as we went. We’d take lunch and dinner breaks, went to bed late, and in the next morning relight the fire from the still burning coals. I also remember Building a Fire; I read a short story in which a father tells the story to his children. Inception, anyone?
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				If I had to note one thing about it, it would be that To Build a Fire, as were many other works around that time, began to be extremely focused. If I were to go back a semester, to Gawain, The Wife of Bath or even Shakespeare, I would say those ones were were entrenched in the world, particularly in regards to history and religion. None of that here. We know the man is in Yukon and that there is an outside world, but the story could easily be about an Inuit man 10.000 years ago and it would not make a difference. I may explore this topic in the other titles.

			<h2>2 - THE HAPPY PRINCE</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158364
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I like happy ends. But not in the way most people do. For most people, a happy end is the protagonist getting what they want and living on „forever after“. But that’s not how the world works; we all die someday. So, what is a happy end if it’s rendered pointless in a couple decades? No, a truly happy end is salvation of the immortal (technically mortal, according to church dogma) soul. It’s the protagonist gaining a kind of salvation they did not even want.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I’m surprised people manage to do Marxist readings of The Happy Prince. It’s clearly not very Marxist. The Happy Prince does not start a revolution, he does not shoot the King’s entire family dead, and he certainly doesn’t redistribute the city’s wealth. Instead, he gives himself, his own body and life to the people of the city with the help of his faithful swallow. All this and some additional symbolism paint the image of Wilde as (in spite of modern depictions) a deeply religious and traditional man.

			<h2>3 - THE GILDED SIX BITS</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158365
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I am somewhat indifferent to the struggles of African Americans, possibly because I am neither African nor American. The topic always felt somewhat distant over here in backwater Eastern Europe, which sees very little Africans, Americans, and African Americans. I once had an African friend, but he was South African, and also Indian. He’s dead now, I think. Lost to the memory of any African, or American.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				You should have seen my face and reaction opening this one up and reading through the dialogue. „Wait… is this Spanish…? No, this is just English… Are they going to speak like that throughout the whole book?“ And speak they did. Ebonics take a while to adjust to. It’s definitely one of the stranger things I read, if only because of the very accurate transcription. Nonetheless, tons of fun.

			<h2>4 - FRANKENSTEIN</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158366
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Frankenstein is one of those books that every single person on earth knows about, but no one has ever read. It’s not that Shelley is a bad writen (she is, but that’s besides the point), but there seems to be a big case of adaptation displacement; that is, no one remembers the original piece, everyone just remembers that dumb-looking monster from the 30s (was it 30s? I don’t know) movie with two big screws in his head. And they call him Frankenstein because everyone forgot who that was.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I can confidently say the original Frankenstein’s complexity is woefully betrayed by the modern portrayal of the plot. Unfortunately, that’s not always a good thing. For whatever reason, Shelley (or maybe Victor?) expects me to be fully interested in ramblings about Agrippa, enlightenment philosophy and wanting to have sex with his fake sister whom he considers an angel because he has some sort of Oedipal love triangle. Often, it just descends into word salad. Someone give me a movie version where the monster doesn’t look like a zombie with earmuffs.

			<h2>5 - OLIVER TWIST</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/resource/view.php?id=160306
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Ah, Kafkaesque black comedy. What, you’re saying I can’t use the word „Kafkaesque“ for works before Kafka? Well, screw you, I say. Kafka would have liked this book. The movies all suck, but the book’s actually pretty good. You could say I’d like some more of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				What can I say? The narration in this book is good, and indeed pretty Kafkaesque. Dickens (ha, his name is Dickens) is able to cram a metric load of snarky commentary into surprisingly short chapters. That’s something a lot of amateur writers seem to do. They seem to think that the reader only cares about exactly what is happening, and want as little commentary as possible. These tend to be people who don’t actually read, but instead watch Game of Thrones and think they’re capable of being writers. But a book’s strength doesn’t lie in its dialogue (well, it does, but not just that). It lies in the author’s ability to set the tone with narration, whether that of a character or an omniscient writer.

			<h2>6 - THE COLONEL’S LADY</h2>
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WqrdstRF4U&list=PLC6c5BRk16d-Tm9Mn9ecqteVF8MPpBnCu<br>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I won’t pretend I understand relationships, the gender disparities of these relationships, or even women in general. I’ve lived with women all my life and I still haven’t been able to crack them. Nonetheless, it’s quite interesting to dissect an uncomfortable topic such as infidelity and its social implications rather than avoiding it and pretending it doesn’t exist. Many writers slip into the pitfall of using their writing as wish fullfillment, and in turn make a word where things which make them uncomfortable simply cannot happen.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				And that’s why The Colonel’s Wife (and to an extent The Gilded Six Bits) is highly interesting for its time. Infidelity is somewhat tabboo even today, and I can hardly imagine its standing a hundred years prior. Being cheated on is wrong for a variety of reasons, but nowadays, it only ruins the image of the cheater, not the one cheated on. I cannot bring myself to imagine being forced to keep something which is not even my fault under wraps, or pretending not to see it when everyone else does.

			<h2>7 - ATTACK ON TITAN</h2>
			https://web.archive.org/web/20101226234319/https://archive.sonichu.com/cwcville/<br>
	<h3>Justification</h3>
			<p>
				Cheating? Well, I beg to differ. Comic books are literature (although very much its own league in terms of how it presents information) and I ran out of actual books to talk about. Attack on Titan is a manga (Japanese comic) which ran for 12 years for 139 issues, and it hosts quite a bit of dialogue, which has been translated into english by both amateurs and professionals.
			</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				And boy, do those vary. The main corpus, as with any translated work, stays the same, but the dialogue can completely differ in tone and tact based on the translator in question. What’s more, the nature of the Japanese language means that all names (which are European in origin) can have multiple readings. This can range from simple spelling differences (Kirstein/Kirschtein, Connie/Conny, Ksaver/Xaver) to completely different readings of names (Dhalis Zachary/Darius Zackley, Bertholdt Hoover/Berlot Fubar, Levi/Rivaille).

			<h2>8 - ATTACK ON TITAN: BEFORE THE FALL</h2>
			<p>
        <a target="_blank" href="Joyce_-_Eveline_from_Dubliners.doc">The text in question</a>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				This one was the licensed „prequel“ to the main manga, taking place 70 to 55 years before the events of the main series, and exploring the rise, fall and rebirth of the Survey Corps. It’s definitely a more „generic“ and „comissioned“ work, but it’s still a nice read for those interested in the setting. However, it still struggles with readings of European names, and this is not helped by its choice to pick more „exotic sounding“ ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				For context, while Attack on Titan did not limit itself to one language, it preferred mostly short names of German origin (Eren Yeager, Armin Arlert, Reiner Braun). The writer of Before the Fall sticks to many of these, but many of his picks are longer, and with a distinctly southern flavour (Cardina Baumeister, Xavi Inocencio, Xenophon Harkimo). More egregiously, some of those names just straight up don’t exist in any European language. So you’re reading though, dodging between Brenkes and Bernhards, and then it hits you with some made-up bullshit like „Sorum Humé“ or „Kuklo“. Sorry, but this is my damn portfolio and I will swear my damn mouth off if it pleases me.
