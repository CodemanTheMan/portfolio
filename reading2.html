			<h1>Reading</h1>
			<h2>1 - THE DREAM OF THE ROOD</h2>
      <p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158361
      </p>
      <p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Is it cheating to use materials from the school curriculum? Much less ones taught to me by the same teacher who is likely reading through this page? Maybe, but I believe I can justify it. The British History and Literature class has introduced me to a variety of high literature and provided me with an opportunity to read it. As such, I have decided to read through the full works and included them all here. The Dream of Room might just be one of my favorite poems in any language, and more than deserves the top spot here.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I find that with many works translated from old english, I have to comb through a passage multiple times before I can fully understand its meaning. Not that I complain, as it is quite beautiful, if not time-consuming. The Dream of Rood is actually the shortest material provided through the British History and Literature class, but it is by no means for the worse, and I can still appreciate its verses.

			<h2>2 - BEOWULF</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158364
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I believe part of the reason for Beowulf's inclusion has been largely covered in the preceding section. I will however mention, perhaps a week after it has been covered in class, I came across a Beowulf thread in 4channel's /tv/ forum, discussing the motion capture movie. And what I discovered is that the adaptation is unfaithful to the original. Whereas in the original Beowulf is a Christian, in the adaptation he is a pagan who despises Christianity. For shame. The thread then devolved into arguing with neo-pagans who refused to believe that Beowulf was Christian. What an unfortunate lot. Sad!
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Beowulf is great. Beowulf is powerful. Beowulf is heroic. Beowulf is also really hard to read through. Is is rather long, yes, and it has the same kind of very flowery archaic language as the Dream of the Rood or Gawain and the Green Knight. The earlier parts, before Beowulf fights Grendel, his mother and the dragon in succession? They were a bit of a slog. But hey, that comes with the territory.

			<h2>3 - GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158365
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				You remember how I mentioned Bertilak is like Shrek, right? Well, this revelation has led me to completely re-evalue the way I see the Shrek franchise. Not only is Shrek extremely similar to Bertilak (being a green monster from the wilderness who comes to the center to test royalty), but they are both also directly related to Arthur. Shrek ultimately places Arthur on the throne of Far Far Away, while Bertilak helps Arthur in "King Arthur and King Cornwall", by defeating a Fairy with a magic bubble. But back to Gawain.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				After growing up in a post-modern world where everything is intentionally subverted, Gawain and the Green Knight feels extremely genuine. There is genuine love for genuine chivalry, genuine love for genuine love, genuine love for the one genuine God, and it's all wrapped in genuine medieval poetry from genuine medieval Britain. Genuinely, I like it. What a breath of fresh air. Also helps with reading comprehension. Translated medieval poetry really does make you put your two remaining brain cells together.

			<h2>4 - THE WIFE OF BATH</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158366
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				This book's bloody hilarious. I might be biased since I only have a male perspective on this, but Chaucer nailed characterization of women on the head. Why do I say that? Because even many hundreds of years after this tale's publication, after several cultural revolutions and a near complete erosion of the roles which existed then, the character of the Wife is perfectly emblematic of a modern woman, for both better or worse. Some things just never change.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Being written much later than the aforementioned works, The Wife of Bath also uses a much more modern language, and is therefore easier to read through even on the first try. The character of the Wife tends to monologue a bit, yes, but that too is part of her character, and I honestly do not mind her rants about how she is controlled by the planets Venus and Mars like she's a mystic trying to prepare a potion of youth for a Habsburg Emperor.

			<h2>5 - ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/resource/view.php?id=160306
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				The Eternal Anglo strikes again, and his name is Robinson Crusoe! With beady black eyes and a burning hatred for civilization, he takes upon the seas, the Maur coasts, the cotton fields of Brasil and the wilderness itself. Hey, I have access to it. Might as well use it, right? It's a little lengthy, but the language and structure are a bit more modern, and there's tons of good historical context.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I used to love that book as a kid. I was honestly surprised it's actually vastly different from the original. But while the concept of selling my best friend into slavery is mind boggling, I actually prefer the ending to the many melodramatic and outright tragic adaptations (in many of which Friday dies). I believe this is similar to the "Bolivian army ending". The show must go on. Robinson and Friday have now become mythical Anglos (or honorary Anglos in the latter's case), spreading their eternal desire for struggle through the rest of the world. I believe Taratino would like an ending like that. Hell, he would really like doing a Crusoe adaptations. He can reinvite Foxx to play Friday, and have Samuel L. Jackson be a wise tribal chief with perfect knowledge of 20th century African-American vernacular.

			<h2>6 - THE FALLEN SAGE</h2>
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WqrdstRF4U&list=PLC6c5BRk16d-Tm9Mn9ecqteVF8MPpBnCu<br>
(A link to a playthrough of The Fallen Sage. Installing it and playing it is actually kind of tricky, as its runs on a twenty year old engine and is balanced so poorly you need to debug to win.)
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				As I have somewhat run out of works in English worth including, I have decided to begin scraping the bottom of the barrel and include some alternative works. The Fallen Sage (or more correctly "The Legend of Zelda: The Fallen Sage") is an anti-example, because by all means it is low art. It is a 2008 fan-game (ergo not made by the IP holder) coded within two years by a 14-year old boy whose only concern at the time was which female character the protagonist should date (Liyer. Definitely Liyer).
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Which is why it is actually a perfect inclusion into reading. Just as it can be difficult to comb through works of high art and their flowery, three-times translated language, it is also difficult to make it through a novel or game whose spelling mistakes actively worsen the readability. At times, the poor spelling makes the dialogue nearly incomprehensible, the writing ranges between bad and so bad it's good, and the name Darunia is erroneously misspelled as "Daurina" throughout the entire game.

			<h2>7 - SONICHU</h2>
			https://web.archive.org/web/20101226234319/https://archive.sonichu.com/cwcville/<br>
(Comics are near the bottom of the page. I genuinely apologize for the site's poor quality. Reader discretion advised.)
	<h3>Justification</h3>
			<p>
				If you had asked me three or even two years ago that I would be attending university and writing a portfolio on Sonichu, I would have called you a jerkop and then go on a non-sequitur about the stone age. Indeed, it is hard to think of a more infamous wildly available work than Sonichu (Maybe The Industrial Society and its Consequences, but I do NOT want to get labeled a terrorist in my third semester.) Sonichu is a series of comics written, scribbled and released by Christine (formerly Christian and Christopher) Weston Chandler, better known as simply "Chris-Chan", an infamous internet celebrity who has lived in infamy for their childlike behavior, bizarre internet appearances and recent controversy which has landed them in jail.
			</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				Words can hardly describe how bizarre and hard to read Sonichu is. Although its spelling is marginally better than that of The Fallen Sage (sorry, Chasen), the actual content and accompanying visual presentation is an utter disaster. A part of the difficulty in reading Sonichu is that Chris-Chan largely lacks a theory of mind, and expects the readers to understand context known only to them, such as inside jokes and outright bewildering neologisms (of which there is an entire dedicated page https://sonichu.com/cwcki/CWC-isms). Similarly to Gantz, Sonichu breaks you down. Unlike Gantz however, Sonichu does not build one back up, but only pushes them deeper into a pit of apathy and confusion.

			<h2>8 - EVELINE</h2>
			<p>
        <a target="_blank" href="Joyce_-_Eveline_from_Dubliners.doc">The text in question</a>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				So, I actually had the task to analyze this short story in the online literature course this semester. We were meant to pick a theme (feminist, psychoanalytical, historical, etc.) and roll with that. Knowing I knew very little of the historical context and ostensibly wasn't (and am still not) a woman or feminist, I picked psychoanalysis, and vaguely quotes Freud as a pretext before rolling with what I saw. Turns out, my laziness produced the best analysis the teacher has seen in that course. Ain't that a surprise.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Eveline's short, but it's pretty packed. Being written in the last century, there is of course no difficulty in reading through it within 15 minutes. But you always come back to something, some small detail or throwaway line that gives tons of context. The weirdest thing to me is that genuine psychoanalysts see an Electra Complex in the main character. I have doubts of the Oedipus/Electra complex as a whole, but how in the world could someone see it in Eveline? Boggles the mind. I need a drink. Freud, if you're listening from hell, I just want you to know this is what you created: an entire field of analysis insistent that every single character in fiction wants to have sex with their mom.
