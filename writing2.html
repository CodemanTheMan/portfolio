      <h2>-- How to navigate and proof-check the wikia--</h2>
			<p>
       The Hyrule Conquest wikia is a subset of the wikimedia project. It allows users to create specialized wikipedias (known as wikias) which go in-detail on specific topics, typically fictional franchises or coding documentation.
			</p>
      <p>
       In each page, you may navigate to the three dots in the top right corner. There, you will find a tab named "history". Upon clicking, you will be redirected to a list of edits, showing how many characters were added. You may see edits made by the account 'DabmobAlt', which is my personal account.
      </p>

			<h2>1 - KINGDOM OF HYRULE (THE FALLEN SAGE AND TIME'S MENAGERIE)</h2>
      <p>
       https://hyruleconquest.fandom.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hyrule_(RPG)
      </p>
      <p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Assuming you clicked "reading" first, you may already be familiar with The Legend of Zelda: The Fallen Sage. After its release, this short-lived "franchise" continued for two more years with a sequel (The Legend of Zelda: Time's Menagerie) and a now lost comic (The Gerudo Wars) before being rebooted as a mod for a Total War game. In recent years, I have spearheaded a revival in interest for this old "franchise", and, with some help, began documenting its story alongside its modern counterparts.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				The Kingdom of Hyrule was one of the largests steps. In addittion to dealing with horrible grammar, I also have to deal with inconsistent chronology (which is quick to retcon itself), scattered information on ten-year old Deviantart pages and logical inconsistencies which my dear friend didn't even think about at the time. I pretty much had to invent anything before year 1 (seriously, civilization began 120 years before The Fallen Sage?), and adjusted the dates to make sense.

			<h2>2 - SULKARIS (THE FALLEN SAGE AND TIME'S MENAGERIE)</h2>
			<p>
       https://hyruleconquest.fandom.com/wiki/Sulkaris_(RPG) 
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Sulkaris was one of the three major villains introduced in The Fallen Sage (the other, Saria and Dark Link existed beforehand), and is also one of the few original characters to still exist in the modern counterpart of the project. Being baby's first main villain, she is also not written very well. If you see her for what she is.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				If you don't see her for what she is (a badly written character), you begin to look at her throwaway lines and find some bizzare Luciferian themes, such as her interpretation of the world as broken and needing of a strong leader to fix. That's not to say this is elaborated upon, this is literally stated once and never brought up by her again. She kind of reverts into a power-hungry pagan goddess. She's still fun though.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>3 - TIMELINE (THE FALLEN SAGE AND TIME'S MENAGERIE)</h2>
			<p>
       https://hyruleconquest.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_(RPG) 
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				As stated before, the timeline of the RPG duology was seldom elaborated upon in the games and extra material. There is exactly one old Deviantart post with clear dates and chronology. But in a story which theoretically spans over a century, a timeline like this is needed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				They say sci-fi writers have no sense of scale. I would like to add a complement to this statement, and that is that fantasy writers have no sense of time. A hundred and twenty years before The Fallen Sage, the Kingdom of Hyrule emerged from Hylian tribes. It took a hundred and twenty years for them to go from tribes to a 13th century medieval kingdom. Keep in mind, there was no benefactor like the Romans, they invented all of their technology. Is magic at play? Maybe. I think Chasen just got lazy though.

			<h2>4 - VAATI (THE FALLEN SAGE AND TIME'S MENAGERIE)</h2>
			<p>
       https://hyruleconquest.fandom.com/wiki/Vaati_(RPG) 
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				You know, Vaati is an extremely contentious character for a completely unbelievable reason. He only had two or three appearances, but was extremely popular because he broke away from the stereotype of having Ganon/Ganondorf as the main villain. Alas, due to copyright issues between Nintendo and Capcom, Vaati has no shown up in any game close to 20 years. Developers will often try to placate the fans by having a Vaati knockoff, but these get laughed at more than anything else.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				It is for this reason the portrayal of Vaati in the duology and comic are hysterically hilarious. He is nothing like in the source material. Rather than being a somewhat cool and cold mastermind, he is an impulsive (though still vastly intelligent) neotenous degenerate sadist with a potty mouth. There is exactly one panel of Vaati from the comic not lost to history; a poignant image of Vaati blocking a fireball while ejaculating his famous line: "Wind beats fire, bitch!". Bravo, Chasen.

			<h2>5 - UNIVERSE (TOTAL WAR)</h2>
			<p>
       https://hyruleconquest.fandom.com/wiki/Universe_(Total_War) 
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				You remember how I was talking about the duology being rebooted into newer projects? Well, let's jump a few years into the future (and past, as this project was also rebooted), and talk about Hyrule Total War a bit. It originally reeled back on some of the stranger elements of the duology and comic (strong language, sexual themes, obsession with Saria), and attempted to present a historical view of Hyrule. And for a while, it worked. Some of the early arcs are almost Shakespearean. Unfortunately, the story was left unfinished (though at least somewhat concluded), and I was tasked with putting a seal on it for the years' sake.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Cosmologies can be weird. Hell, even Christian cosmology (the one most known in the western world) can be weird at times. But a world where every planet is secretly an egg hatching a god? Yeah, that's outright bizzare. I kind of like it. It's like Hobbes' Leviathan, except more esoteric and cosmic. My friend has recurring dreams of the Leviathan. They're nuts. Where was I? Oh yeah. Kind of glad this cosmology got shafted for a more traditional one. Now instead of the universe being a bunch of rotting eggs, it's actually layers of an onion.

			<h2>6 - EVELINE'S LONGING - A PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (+ ANALYSIS OF MATERIAL)</h2>
			<a target="_blank" href="EvelineAnalysis.rtf">The Analysis</a>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Righty. I took an online literature course this semester, figuring it would be a good way to get some extra credits without having to spend too much time. Boy, was I wrong. It's actually one of my harder courses this semester. Not too long ago, one of our tasks was to do an analysis of Eveline, a short story by James Joyce. This is my analysis, which has accidentally proven to be one of my better pieces of work.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Oh yeah, it's Freud time. I don't hate Freud. I don't even think he was that bad at his time or retrospectively. Hell, I love the Freudian trio, I use it in short stories myself. But for God's sake Freud, you should have been lynched for anything involving children. You know, I actually though I was being lazy only using him as a pretext. I just could not be bothered to research previous analyses and repeat what they said. Besides, I did not see the superego anywhere.
			</p>

			<h2>7 - MY POETRY</h2>
			<a target="_blank" href="MyPoetry.rtf">The actual thing</a>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Verily, say I<br>
        that I don't care to justify<br>
        including poetry<br>
        for its existence then<br>
        justifies itself<br>
        so I present to thee.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I had fun<br>
        with days under the sun<br>
        composing verse<br>
        for I get to say<br>
        well, if I may<br>
        that the world's seen worse.
			</p>

			<h2>8 - THIS PORTFOLIO</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				What do you mean this is cheating? Nowhere in the rules does it say that I cannot go meta with this. Now, am I scraping the bottom of the barrel? The answer is yes. I am scraping the bottom of the barrel. But look. I haven't counted how many words there are in this portfolio, but I am fairly confident it is within the several hundreds, and it grows with every justification and reflection I write. Over the two semesters, this has actually been the bulk of my writing. And that's why I'm including it here.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				It has come to my attention that both this subject and other subjects (such as methodology) actually expect quite a bit of self-reflection. While I say that is a load of bologna, I must admit I understand where it is coming from. Humanity has the unique ability to improve simply by thinking for a few hours. Call me animalistic then, but I have never been on this kind of reflection. My self-reflection has typically stemed from emotionally powerful moments; big mistakes, big hits. I simply run on autopilot most of the time, and God knows I am busy enough. I don't think about every piece I included. Not everything I write is necessarily a learning experience for me. Not every moment is worth reflection. One has to live in the present and future, and not just the past.
