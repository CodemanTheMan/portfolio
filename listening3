			<h2>1 - THIS IS ENGLAND (2006)</h2>
      <p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158361
      </p>
      <p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Man, first listening article and I already feel like I’m scraping the bottom of the barrel. I was tasked with watching this movie for my British History class. I wasn’t sure what to expect going in, and was not even aware it was a proper-length movie. Nonetheless, it was a highly relatable and heartfelt experience watching Shaun (Sean? Who knows) go from lonely boy to young extremist.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				First thing you notice is the characters definitely don’t have Received Pronounciation. No, these are common folk with an accent comparable to Wallachians in the Czech Republic. It’s something truly beautiful to hear. Sometimes, they are just straight up incomprehensible. However, this might be less the fault of the accent, and more the fault of every single character being, in the movie’s own words, a „focking mong“.

			<h2>2 - HIGH QUALITY VOICE ACTING</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158364
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I have no good justification for High Quality Voice acting. And neither should you. Just sit back, but on your headphones, and enjoy chaos.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				High Quality Voice Acting is truly a diverse collection of clips. In some of them, the actors sound bored, disinterested, or just underpaid. On the other side of the coin, you have the good bad acting; the kind where the actors unleash the ham, produce horrible sounds, overact and most importantly have fun with it. Or perhaps you prefer the clips where the voice actors don’t understand a lick of english and just wing it. The possibilities are endless.

			<h2>3 - THE KURSED PROJECT</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158365
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Yeah, no, I’ve scraped the bottom of the previous barrel clean and started scraping the top of the one below it. I wonder what’s inside. White wine? Bourbon? A bunch of sewage? I mean, I like this podcast. I wasn’t there for it live, but I watched it more than one time, which is kind of uncommon for me. It’s informative and a good time.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I think we’ve all been in a situation where we get excited about a work project, and then are sorely dissapointed to find out the other people in the group are „idea guys“; the most useless kind of teammate. Always has an idea, always has an image, but has none of the skills nor drive to acquire said skills necessary to bringing that idea into existence. They barely even get a pencil and sketch up some concept art. But they’re sure to critique whatever you actually make and are quick to point out your many errors. Man, screw those people.

			<h2>4 - BEOWULF – SEAMUS HEANEY</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/folder/view.php?id=158366
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I’m getting deja vu. Didn’t I just write about Beewolf in my last semester? Well, yeah, I did, but that was the actual book. You wanna know how to get through reading Beowulf without going crazy? Go listen to this audiobook with a Skyrim background and sound effects (haha, I get it, it’s because Skyrim references Beowulf constantly). In a way, this is the way Beowulf is meant to be experienced; not read, but listened to in the mead hall as the old wiseman recounts the tale passed down through many generations.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Beewolf. Oh, Beewolf. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m sure this was a completely badass name back in the day; Sting like a bee, fly like a wolf. I mean, bite like a wolf. Yeah. But c’mon, imagine if we made names like this in our day. Waspcougar. Hawkdog. Mantiskung. Not so badass now, especially since we hunted or poisoned most animals to extinction. Or maybe the Anglo-Saxons had some mythical hybrid animal called the Beewolf. Half-bee, half-wolf. Oh, to bee a Beowulf. No, I really don’t have anything to reflect upon with this one, sorry.

			<h2>5 - THE WALKING DEAD (2010 – 2022)</h2>
			<p>
       https://moodlinka.ics.muni.cz/mod/resource/view.php?id=160306
      </p>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Am I halfway done already? Good, because I don’t think I will be able to come up with anything like this for the last semester. The Walking Dead was a thing that happened, and it somehow managed to run for 13 seasons by stretching out the source material before attempting to become a zombie version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has acting and voice, I suppose. Does this count? Can I just list anything with sound and pretend it’s a learning experience?
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				I mean, to be fair, it is a learning experience in some regards. The protagonist, Rick, is an American character played by the British actor Andrew Lincoln. For the most part, Lincoln does a very convincing American accent. He slips sometimes, but you generally wouldn’t know he’s British. However, there is one exception. Whenever he adresses his son, Carl, he goes very hard on the American pronounciation, turning the name into something closer to „Coral“. Coooraaaaal. Cooooraaaaal! Your mother’s dead, Cooooraaaaaal! It’s so prominent that even the other actors eventually became infected with this pronounciation. And thus, a meme was born.

			<h2>6 - NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN</h2>
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WqrdstRF4U&list=PLC6c5BRk16d-Tm9Mn9ecqteVF8MPpBnCu<br>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Since we’re going for „including any movie that has characters speak weird accents“, let’s go for No Country for Old Men. No Country for Old Men (or NCFOM for short) is a really good movie. And I don’t mean „blockbuster good“. I mean this is genuinely one of the most thoughtful, well-shot, well-acted, well-written and well-directed movies out there. Good on you, Cohen brothers. It’s up there with Downfall and the Lighthouse (which I will get into shortly).
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				There’s a couple different accents there. Taking place in the deep American south (pretty much right on the Mexican border), the characters speak in very heavy southern dialects. Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, even Kelly MacDonald (who is Celtic) did a really good job. More interestingly, the Cohen brothers specifically cast Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh. Chigurh originally wanted to reject the role because in his own words, he „hates guns, hates violence and cannot speak English very well“. However, all of these three, and particularly his strange Spanish accent worked to create a one-of-a-kind character.

			<h2>7 - SONICHU</h2>
			https://web.archive.org/web/20101226234319/https://archive.sonichu.com/cwcville/<br>
	<h3>Justification</h3>
			<p>
				HAAAAAAAAARK! HARK, Cadmus, HARK! Below, bid our father the word king rise from the depths, full foul in his pride, black words teeming with mouth foam to smother these young eyes with pungent slime. To choke ye! Engorging your senses till ye turn red and tensed with fumes and salt and can read no more! Only when he, crowned in leaded pens, with wind-breaking paper wings and leaking ink, take off his fell, emaciated arm, his ink-tinted wails muse-like in the silence and plunges right through your ear!
			</p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				Choking ye! A thinking noggin no more, but an empty bloody thing now of nothing for the siren send the souls of dead writers to bite and gnaw and feed upon, only to be lapped up and swallowed by the infinite darkness of the word emperor himself. Forgotten to any man, to any time, and unto any God or devil, forgotten even to the word. For any stuff, or any part of ye, even any scantling of your soul is ye no more, but is now itself the word.

			<h2>8 - DJANGO UNCHAINED</h2>
			<p>
        <a target="_blank" href="Joyce_-_Eveline_from_Dubliners.doc">The text in question</a>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				Alright, one last scrape of what’s left of the barrels. Django Unchained is a recent title in Quentin Tarantino’s filmography. What that means is this movie is a decade old. It takes place in the 19th century south, focusing on the story of a freed slave and his bounty hunter friend as they attempt to rescue his wife. What that means is there is a variety of accents.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Of course, there is Jamie Foxx’s and Samuel L. Jackson’s African American accents, which are natural. Leonardo Dicaprio plays a slave owner in this movie. While he is more notable for saying the n-word about 50 times (it might even be a record for a Hollywood picture), he also does a great job with his southern accent, and you can really hear the talent behind them. Last but not least, Christopher Waltz plays a German for the second time in a Tarantino movie (ironically not a racist this time), and his performance is as great as ever. I highly recommend watching this one.
