			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Hey, hey, people. As you can see by the flashing neon letters plastered over this site, I am Karel Havlíček, 20 years old student of the Masaryk University's Pedagogical Faculty (MUNI PED). I have been asked by my teacher, Peter Nobbs to make an online portfolio. First of all, I would like to thank by brother, Michal Havlíček for programming the portfolio. It wouldn't exist without him. I likewise thank everyone who has participated with me on these projects, created the material I used and generally been a positive influence. To the reader, I wish a pleasant use of this site. As I know my brother, he has surely worked hard on what we in Czech call "vymazlení" of this site. Below, you will find several link which take you to sub-sites for the materials.

			<h1>Goals (2nd semester)</h1>
			<p>
				Coming off a hard-fought first semester in which I passed with a surplux of one (1) credit, I wanted my second to be less stressful by choosing better subjects and actually working a bit on the mandatory ones, in particular grammar. With regards to my spoken word, I wanted to speak more clearly and get rid of my slurring, as well as get rid of invasive words.
			</p>
			<h1>Self-assesment</h1>
			<p>
				While at the time of me writing this I cannot yet judge my hard work, I must unfortunately report I have not made much progress on my slurring and invasive words. Although I can be understood, I've not yet gotten to a point of clarity which some of my classmates have reached. I do feel confident in my ability to hold a conversation, however.
