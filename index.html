			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Hey, hey, people. As you can see by the flashing neon letters plastered over this site, I am Karel Havlíček, 20 years old student of the Masaryk University's Pedagogical Faculty (MUNI PED). I have been asked by my teacher, Peter Nobbs to make an online portfolio. First of all, I would like to thank by brother, Michal Havlíček for programming the portfolio. It wouldn't exist without him. I likewise thank everyone who has participated with me on these projects, created the material I used and generally been a positive influence. To the reader, I wish a pleasant use of this site. As I know my brother, he has surely worked hard on what we in Czech call "vymazlení" of this site. Below, you will find several link which take you to sub-sites for the materials.

			<h1>Goals (2nd semester)</h1>
			<p>
				Coming off a hard-fought first semester in which I passed with a surplux of one (1) credit, I wanted my second to be less stressful by choosing better subjects and actually working a bit on the mandatory ones, in particular grammar. With regards to my spoken word, I wanted to speak more clearly and get rid of my slurring, as well as get rid of invasive words.
			</p>
			<h1>Self-assesment</h1>
			<p>
				While at the time of me writing this I cannot yet judge my hard work, I must unfortunately report I have not made much progress on my slurring and invasive words. Although I can be understood, I've not yet gotten to a point of clarity which some of my classmates have reached. I do feel confident in my ability to hold a conversation, however.

			<h1>Goals (3rd semester)</h1>
			<p>
				 Say, it's been a bit of a rough year. Well, if I am to be honest, the first semester was still the worst. They say we learn by mistakes, and boy did I make mistakes back then. But that's neither here nor there. I've been tasked with uploading the portfolio and reflecting. Again. Well, I think I've made progress on the slurring. I just have a habit of trying to sound American when British is so much clearer. My next goal? Learn how to not run out of things to say. Or something.

			<h1>Goals (4th semester)</h1>
			<p>
				Oh boy, it’s that time of the year again. Gotta do this again and come up with some vague arbitrary goal to apparently fix. And look, I did fix my slurring. I still pronounce things in this weird combination of British and Texan, but it’s a bit more comprehensible. My goal this semester? Get into a better state of mind. Took me a while to notice that I was really in the „zone“ last semester when I had the most work I ever had. I have a little bit less this semester, and it’s harder to get into the mindset where I’m just concentrating on my work.
