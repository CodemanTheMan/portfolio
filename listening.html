			<h3>Justification</h3>
				I will not hide that I am somewhat of a fan of Jonathan Pageau and his brother Matthieu. For someone of my middling intelligence and shaky faith, having someone much more versed in the subject step in and dumb the topic down for me has been a great help to my understanding of scripture, as well as cultural elements from other cultures. One could say I watch him religiously.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Jonathan Pageau's videos are a good practice for listening comprehension, as well as comprehension of ideas in general. While the explanation might be dumbed down, the subject itself is presented in its full complexity, and it takes a while to digest.

					<h2><em>ONATHAN PAGEAU - THE SURPRISING SYMBOLISM OF 666</em></h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qM_kQjpAK6g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<h3>Justification</h3>
				The subject of the 666 is one close to my heart, as it is the concept on which society is based on, and one which I have grown to silently despise. I will let the video speak for itself, as it is quire intriguing.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Reflection</h3>
				All of what I've said about the Dog-headed man video applies here. Of note is Jonathan Pageau's very subtle Canadian accent, which shines in its clarity despite being so similar to the American accent. We are lucky he is not French Canadian, or he would be incomprehensible.
