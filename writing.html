			<h2>1 - YOU HAVE ONE MESSAGE</h2>
			<a target="_blank" href="youhaveonemessage.pdf">The full story</a>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				I had originally gotten the idea after starting a very intriguing game of Rimworld. Rimworld works on a largely generative system. That means places, characters and events are randomly generated and the player has to adapt to keep their characters alive. The first chapter, which had unfortunately not developed into a full series was my first serious attempt at writing. Special thanks goes to my classmate Sarah Palet, who has been my most positive critic and the reason I wrote the second chapter.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				In retrospect, I am not completely satisfied, in spite of Sarah's glowing review. The inner monologues written in cursive could have been longer and conveyed more complex ideas, instead of simply breaking up the actual narration. However, according to Sarah, they do help the reader get into the head of the protagonist, even as she is nearly completely anonymous and her age, physical appearance and personality is largely left unrevealed until the second chapter. What I am particularly fond of are the opening lines, which have survived multiple drafts.

			<h2>2 - OUT THERE</h2>
			<a target="_blank" href="outthere.pdf">The full story</a>
			<p>
				<h3>Justification</h3>
				A following to the original chapter, now from the eyes of a different protagonist as he meets the first chapter's protagonist and new characters. Originally written on Sarah's prompt and still based on my Rimworld playthrough. The second chapter is much longer than the previous one, and expands on the world beyond the protagonists' vault.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				Most of my reflection on the first chapter applies here. Of note is my attempt at giving the characters outside the vault Southern US dialects, which I thought nicely fit their wild west aesthetic. I'd like to think that was a success.
